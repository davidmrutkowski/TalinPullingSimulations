# TalinStretching
Simulation codes used to investigate work done by a single Talin molecule as it is stretched, its domains unfold, and it unbinds. <br>
(Yamashiro S., Rutkowski D.M., Lynch K.A., Liu Y., Vavylonis D., and Watanabe, N., <i>Force transmission by retrograde actin flow-induced dynamic molecular stretching of Talin.</i> Submitted to Nature Communications). <br>
Talin is represented as beads connected by springs that can unfold by force, bound at one end to a static integrin and the other to a moving actin layer.
