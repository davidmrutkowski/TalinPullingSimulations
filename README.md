# TalinStretching
Simulation codes used to investigate work done by a single Talin molecule as it is stretched, its domains unfold, and it unbinds. 
(Yamashiro et al.  All authors and title, submitted to Nature Communications). 
Talin is represented as beads connected by springs that can unfold by force, bound at one end to a static integrin and the other to a moving actin layer.
